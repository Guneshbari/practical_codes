//////////////////////////////////////////////
1. hostname:
The hostname command helps display and change a system's hostname and domain
and identifies devices within a network environment.
Syntax: hostname [options] [name]

2. ping:
The ping command is a network utility for testing whether a host is reachable. The
command sends ICMP requests to a host (a computer or server) and measures the round-trip
time (RTT). Pinging helps determine the network latency between two nodes and whether a
network is reachable.
Syntax: ping [options] [hostname/IP]

3. ip:
The ip command is a unified networking tool for Linux systems. The ip command helps view
and configure routing, interfaces, network devices, and tunnels.
Syntax: ip [options] object [command]
Each part of the command does the following:
• [options] are the command-line parameters that modify the command's behavior.
• object represents the available objects for configuration.
• [command] is a subcommand, an action performed on an object. The available
commands differ depending on the object.
The ip -V prints the package and library version for the ip utility.
The ip addr command manages and shows network interface IP addresses.
The ip route command shows and configures the IP routing table. The command allows
users to adjust the routing table and perform other crucial networking tasks with the routing
table.

4. route:
The route command in Linux is a specialized command for displaying and
configuring the routing table. The command modifies the kernel's IP routing tables and helps
set up static routes to specific hosts or networks.
Syntax: route [options] [subcommand] [arguments]

5. host:
The host command is a simple tool for performing DNS lookups. The command
resolves IP addresses into domain names and vice versa.
Syntax: host [options] [hostname/IP]

6. dig:
The dig command queries Domain Name Systems (DNS) and finds information for
DNS records. The command collects domain name information and associated records.
Syntax: dig [options] [domain] [record type] [DNS server]
7. nslookup:

The nslookup command is similar to the dig command. The main difference
between the two commands is that nslookup features an interactive mode. It enables
diagnosing and querying DNS servers, which is helpful for network troubleshooting and DNS
tasks.
Syntax: nslookup [domain] [DNS server]

8. netstat:
The netstat command (network statistics) is a networking utility that shows various
networking statistics. The command provides statistics for network ports and shows port
availability.
Syntax: netstat [options]

9. traceroute:
The traceroute command is a networking diagnostics tool available for Linux,
macOS, and Windows. The command tracks the route that packets take to reach a destination
on a TCP/IP network. It is used to discover routing issues and bottlenecks by showing a packet's
intermediate hops while traveling from source to destination.
Syntax: traceroute [options] [hostname/IP]

10. arp:
The arp command shows and configures the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache. The
ARP protocol maps IP addresses to physical Media Access Control (MAC) addresses in a local
network. The cache stores these mappings for all devices on the local network.
Syntax: arp [options] [hostname/IP]
