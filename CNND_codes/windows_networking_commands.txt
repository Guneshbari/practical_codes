Aim: To perform basic networking commands in windows command prompt and understand
their functions.

////////////////////////////////
1.hostname
• It will provide the name of your computer. The first part of the result is the name of a
computer and the second part is the name of the domain.

2. ping
• Ping is used to testing a network host capacity to interact with another host.
• This is performed by using the Internet Control Message Protocol, which allows the
echo packet to be sent to the destination host and a listening mechanism.

3. ipconfig
• The command IP config will display basic details about the device’s IP address
configuration.

4.netstat
• The netstat provides the statistics and information in the use of the current TCP-IP
Connection network about the protocol.

5. tracert
• The trace route (tracert) command is a Command Prompt command which is used to
get the network packet being sent and received and the number of hops required for that
packet to reach to target.

6. nslookup
• The nslookup, which stands for name server lookup command, is a network utility
command used to obtain information about internet servers.

7. route
• In IP networks, routing tables are used to direct packets from one subnet to another.
• The Route command provides the device’s routing tables. To get this result, just type
route print.

8. arp
• ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. Although network communications can
readily be thought of as an IP address, the packet delivery depends ultimately on the
media access control (MAC). This is where the protocol for address resolution comes
into effect.
